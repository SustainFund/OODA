# OODA
An Observe-Orient-Decide-Act productivity application designed for the especially competitive and rapidly-changing environment faced by entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs must continually updating their assumptions, adapt based on their situational awareness and move quickly from one decision and iteration to the next in a way that allows them to both exploit the failures and inertia of [large] competitors AND recover quickly from small mistakes. It is a matter of looking at new features and advantages that competitors were trying to advance and quickly iterating to match or beat the sought-after advantage.
